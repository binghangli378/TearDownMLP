# TearDownMLP
## Overview
TearDownMLP is a step-by-step implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network built from scratch, without the use of deep learning frameworks. This repository is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the inner workings of MLPs by breaking down each component into simple, understandable pieces.
## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository. You can download the dataset from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gi7qdc0fkjN7ChVyQfalNXbXDPcsVKSI?usp=sharing).
## How to run the code
1. Download the dataset
2. Open the codes.ipynb notebook file in Google Colab.
3. Upload the dataset files including ORL and YaleB datasets to the /content/ directory in
Colab. If you are using a different directory, adjust the file paths in the code accordingly.
4. Ensure all files are fully uploaded before running the code.
5. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed in the Colab environment, such as NumPy,
Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
6. Execute all cells in the notebook by pressing Ctrl+F9 or selecting Runtime -> Run
all from the Colab menu.
